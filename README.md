# Sample HW for DSA
## Contents
The file `linkedlist_starter.py` is the template that Alice (S'20) provided for the
linked list assignment.

## Supplemental Questions (To be asked @ Check-in!)

How does a doubly-linked list compare to a regular Python list? Name some similarities and differences.

How did you make sure that the DLL was still functioning even as you removed a node? (Talk through the assignment process).

How did you keep track of the length of the DLL?
